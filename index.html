<h2>Bio</h2>

<p> I am currently enrolled at the University of North Carolina at Pembroke.
  When I was in the United States Coast Guard, I was lucky to be able to train and supervise multiple young professionals.
  I worked to diagnose and repair the onboard mechanical and electrical equipment.
  I also derived new more efficient methods to accomplish routine tasks.
  I gained experience in leadership, communications, and problem solving.
  I am looking to start a career in the Cybersecurity field.  <p>

<h2>Hobbies</h2>

<p> I am a HAM radio operator. My favorite radio technology is software defined radio which allows my to recive and decode radio signals with my computer.
  I also enjoy working on cars in my free time.
  I have performed turbo swaps and reprogrammed the engine computer using open-source tuning software. <p>
